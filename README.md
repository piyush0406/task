# Task APIs

This readme file provides instructions on how to run a Node.js project using the `npm start` command.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

1. **Node.js**: You'll need Node.js to run the project. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **npm (Node Package Manager)**: npm is usually included with Node.js, so there's no need to install it separately. However, you can check if it's installed by running `npm -v` in your terminal.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the Node.js project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the project repository from GitHub or another source:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open your terminal and change the current directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd <project_folder>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the project's dependencies specified in the `package.json` file:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Project**: Finally, start the Node.js project by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will execute the `start` script defined in the `package.json` file. It typically starts the Node.js server and runs your application.

5. **Access the Application**: Once the project is running, open your web browser and navigate to the appropriate URL. By default, the application might be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Stopping the Application

To stop the running Node.js application, you can usually use `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the application is running. This will terminate the server and stop the application.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the project, refer to the project's documentation or check for error messages in the terminal. Common issues might include missing dependencies, incorrect configuration, or port conflicts.
